smb.conf - Samba の設定ファイル
.SH "概要"
.PP
\fIsmb\.conf\fR
ファイルは Samba システムの設定ファイルである。\fIsmb\.conf \fR
には、Samba システムの各プログラムが実行時に参照する設定情報が記述される。
\fIsmb\.conf\fR
ファイルは、\fBswat\fR(8)
プログラムによって設定、 管理されるように設計されている。 以下参照目的で、ファイルの形式と設定可能なパラメータに関して網羅的に記述する。
.SH "ファイルの形式"
.PP
ファイルはセクションとパラメータから構成される。セクションは、 大括弧(\(lq[\(rq
と
\(lq]\(rq) で囲まれたセクション名で始まり、次のセクションが始まるまで 続く。セクション内には以下の形式でパラメータが記述される:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fIパラメータ名（パラメータ）\fR = \fIパラメータ値（値）\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
ファイルは行を基本単位とし、改行で終了する各行は、コメント、 セクション名、パラメータのいずれかを表す。
.PP
セクション名およびパラメータ名は大文字と小文字を区別しない。
.PP
パラメータを示す行では、最初の 「=」 文字に重要な意味がある。 最初の 「=」 文字の前後の空白文字は破棄される。 セクション名およびパラメータ名の先頭、 途中、末尾にある空白文字は 無視される。パラメータ値の先頭と末尾にある空白文字も無視される。 ただし、パラメータ値の途中にある空白文字はそのまま意味を持つ。
.PP
セミコロン (\(lq:\(rq)、シャープ (\(lq#\(rq) で始まる行や、空白のみの行は 無視される。
.PP
\(lq\e\(rq
文字で終わる行は、UNIX の慣習通り次の行へ継続する。
.PP
「=」文字に続くパラメータ値には、文字列 (引用符で囲む必要はない)、または真偽値を表す、yes/no、0/1、true/false のいずれかを記述する。真偽値の場合、大文字と小文字は同じ意味だが、 記述されたとおりの文字列が保存される。 create mask など、幾つかのパラメータ値は数値となる。
.SH "セクションの説明"
.PP
設定ファイル中の ([global] セクションを除く) 各セクションでは、 共有リソース (単に\(lq共有\(rqとも呼ぶ (訳注: 「サービス」とも呼ばれる)) の設定が行なわれる。 セクション名は共有リソース名となり、 セクション内のパラメータは共有の設定に利用される。
.PP
[global]、[homes]、[printers] という 3 つの特殊なセクションに ついては、\fI特殊なセクション\fR
で説明する。 以下の説明は、通常のセクションについてのものである。
.PP
共有の設定としては、大きくアクセスを許可するディレクトリの設定と それを利用するユーザに対するアクセス許可の設定とがある。 その他いくつかの補助的なオプションの指定も可能である。
.PP
セクションは、ファイル共有サービス (クライアントからファイルシステムの延長として利用される) とプリントサービス (クライアントからサーバ上で動作している 印刷サービスにアクセスするために利用される) のいずれかに分類される。
.PP
セクションは、パスワードなしでアクセスできる
\fIゲスト\fR
サービスとして構成することもできる。 この場合、UNIX 側で指定された\fIゲストアカウント\fRの権限でアクセスが 行なわれる。
.PP
ゲストサービス以外のセクションにアクセスするにはパスワードが 必要である。通常クライアントからはユーザ名も提供されるが、 年代物のクライアントはパスワードのみでユーザ名を提供しないため、
\(lquser =\(rq
パラメータで指定したユーザのリストを用いてパスワードの検証を 行なうことも可能である。Windows 95/98/Me/NT/2000 のような最近の クライアントでは、このパラメータは不要である。
.PP
Samba より与えられたアクセス権は、システムより UNIX ユーザ (またはゲストユーザ) に与えられたアクセス権によって制限されることに注意して欲しい。 Samba はシステムが許可する以上のアクセス権を許可することはできない。
.PP
以下の簡単なセクションは、ファイル共有を定義するものである。 ユーザは
\fI/home/bar\fR
に対して書き込みができる。 共有は、foo
という共有名でアクセス可能である:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
	\fI[foo]\fR
	\fIpath = /home/bar\fR
	\fIread only = no\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
以下の簡単なセクションは印刷サービスを定義するものである。 共有は読み取りのみであるが、印刷可能である。これは、 スプールファイルのオープン、書き込み、クローズという作業についてのみ書き込みが許可されるということである。\fIguest ok\fR
パラメータは、(別途定義された) デフォルトのゲストユーザとしてアクセスが許可されていることを意味する:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
	\fI[aprinter]\fR
	\fIpath = /usr/spool/public\fR
	\fIread only = yes\fR
	\fIprintable = yes\fR
	\fIguest ok = yes\fR
.fi
.RE
.sp
.SH "特殊なセクション"
.SS "[global] セクション"
.PP
このセクション中のパラメータは、サーバ全体に対して、 もしくは各セクションで項目が定義していないときの既定値として 適用される。詳細な情報はパラメータ(PARAMETERS)の節を参照のこと。
.SS "[homes] セクション"
.PP
homes セクションが設定ファイル中にあると、 接続してきたユーザのホームディレクトリを共有するサービスが 必要時にサーバによって作成されるようになる。
.PP
接続の要求が行なわれると、存在するセクションが検索される。 要求に合致するセクションが見つかった場合はそのセクションが 利用される。見つからなかった場合は、 要求されたセクション名をユーザ名とみなしてローカルのパスワードファイルが検索される。 ファイル中に名前が存在して、パスワードが適切だった場合、 [homes] セクションの設定を引き継ぐ形で共有が作成される。
.PP
新しく作成される共有に対しては、 幾つかの変更が行なわれる:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
共有名は、homes からユーザ名に変更される。
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
path パラメータが設定されていなかった場合、 ディレクトリのパスはユーザのホームディレクトリに設定される。
.sp
.RE
.PP
\fIpath = \fR
行を [homes] セクションに記述した場合、"%S" マクロを用いると便利になる 場合があるかも知れない。以下に一例を示す:
.PP
\fBpath = /data/pchome/%S\fR
.PP
これは、UNIX からのアクセスと PC からのアクセスとでホームディレクトリが異なる場合に便利である。
.PP
これは多数のクライアントに対するホームディレクトリの 提供を最小の手間で素早く簡単に実現する方法である。
.PP
要求されたセクション名が
\(lqhomes\(rq
の場合にも同様の処理が行われるが、共有名が要求したユーザの 名前に変更されることはない。 [homes] セクションを使用する 方法は、複数のユーザがクライアント PC を共有する場合に 便利である。
.PP
[homes] セクションでは、通常のサービスで指定可能な すべてのパラメータを指定できるが、幾つかのものは他の セクションと少し違った意味になる。以下は典型的な [homes] セクションの例である:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fI[homes]\fR
\fIread only = no\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
重要な点として、[homes] セクションでゲストアクセスを許可した場合、 全てのホームディレクトリが全てのクライアントから
\fIパスワードなしで\fR
アクセス可能になるという点が挙げられる。 ほとんどあり得ないと思うが、もしこの設定を実際に行なうのであれば、\fI読み取り専用\fR
アクセスの設定にしておくことが好ましいであろう。
.PP
自動的に作成されるホームディレクトリの
\fIbrowseable\fR
パラメータの値は、[homes] セクションの browseable パラメータからではなく、[global] セクションの browseable パラメータより継承される。これは、 [homes] セクションで
\fIbrowseable = no\fR
を指定して [homes] 共有を不可視にしても、自動的に作成されるホームディレクトリを表示させるようにするための仕様である。
.SS "[printers] セクション"
.PP
このセクションは、プリンタ用の [homes] セクションに 相当する。
.PP
[printers] セクションが設定されていると、ユーザは、 ローカルホストの printcap ファイルで設定されている各プリンタに接続することが可能となる。
.PP
接続の要求が行なわれると、存在するセクションが検索される。 要求に合致するセクションが見つかった場合はそのセクションが利用される。 見つからなかった場合、[homes] セクションがあれば前述した処理が行なわれる。 それでも要求が解決できない場合は、 要求されたセクション名をプリンタ名とみなし、 適切な pritcap ファイルが検索され、 要求されたセクション名をプリンタ共有名とみなすかどうかの 確認が行なわれる。ファイル中に名前が存在した場合は、 [printers] セクションの設定を引き継ぐ形でプリンタ共有が 作成される。
.PP
新しく作成される共有に対しては、 幾つかの変更が行なわれる:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
共有名には、実際のプリンタ名が設定される。
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
プリンタ名が設定されていない場合、 プリンタ名として実際のプリンタ名が設定される。
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
共有がゲストアクセスを許可しておらず、 username パラメータも指定されていない場合、username に実際のプリンタ名が設定される。
.sp
.RE
.PP
[printers] サービスは、必ず printable にすること。 それ以外の設定を行なうと、サーバが設定ファイルの読み取りを 拒否してしまう。
.PP
通常指定されるパスは、sticky ビットが設定され、 誰でも書き込み可能になっているスプールディレクトリである。 典型的な [printers] のエントリは次のようになる:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
\fI[printers]\fR
\fIpath = /usr/spool/public\fR
\fIguest ok = yes\fR
\fIprintable = yes\fR
.fi
.RE
.PP
printcap ファイル中で定義されているすべてのプリンタの エイリアス(別名)は、プリンタ名として認識される。 印刷システムが printcap ファイルのような機構を使用して いないのであれば、仮の printcap ファイルを設定する必要がある。 このファイルは以下のような形式の行で構成される:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
alias|alias|alias|alias\.\.\.    
.fi
.RE
.PP
各エイリアスは、印刷システムが処理可能なプリンタ名で ある必要がある。[global] セクションで、別のファイルを printcap ファイルとして指定することで、仮想的な printcap ファイル中にある名前のみがサーバに認識される。 もちろんこのファイル中には任意のエイリアスを記述することが 可能である。このテクニックは、ローカルプリンタの一部のみに アクセスを制限する機能を簡単に実現するためにも利用できる。
.PP
なお、エイリアスとは printcap ファイル中の各レコードの 最初のエントリに続く各要素をさす。 各レコードは改行コードで区切られ、各要素は (複数個存在する場合) 縦棒 (|) で区切られる。
.sp
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
Note
.PP
lpstat コマンドによりシステムで定義されている プリンタの一覧を取得可能な SYSV 系のシステムでは、
printcap name = lpstat
とすることで、 プリンタの一覧を取得することが可能である。 詳細は、printcap name
オプションを参照のこと。
.SH "ユーザ定義共有"
.PP
Samba 3\.0\.23 より、root 以外のユーザが共有の追加、修正、削除を行なうことを可能とする機能が追加された。 この機能を
\fIユーザ定義共有(usershares)\fR
と呼び、 smb\.conf の

セクションで定義される一連のパラメータによって制御される。 関連するパラメータを以下に示す :
.PP
usershare allow guests
.RS 4
ユーザ定義共有でゲストアクセスを許可するかどうかを制御する。
.RE
.PP
usershare max shares
.RS 4
作成を許可するユーザ定義共有の最大数を制御する。
.RE
.PP
usershare owner only
.RS 4
有効にすると、ユーザが所有しているディレクトリのみが共有可能となる。
.RE
.PP
usershare path
.RS 4
ユーザ定義共有を作成可能なディレクトリを指定する。 実際にユーザ定義共有を作成可能かどうかは、ファイルシステム上のディレクトリのパーミッションに依存する。
.RE
.PP
usershare prefix allow list
.RS 4
共有を許可するディレクトリの絶対パス名をコンマで区切って列挙する。 ここで指定されたパス名から始まるディレクトリのみが共有を許可される。
.RE
.PP
usershare prefix deny list
.RS 4
共有を拒否するディレクトリの絶対パス名をコンマで区切って列挙する。 ここで指定されたパス名から始まるディレクトリは共有を拒否される。
.RE
.PP
usershare template share
.RS 4
新しいユーザ定義共有を作成する際のテンプレートとなる既存の共有を指定する。 ユーザ定義共有の定義時に指定されなかったすべての共有に関するパラメータは、この共有のものが用いられる。
.RE
.PP
UNIX グループ
foo
のメンバにユーザ定義共有の作成を許可したい場合は、 共有の定義ファイルを格納するディレクトリを以下のように作成する:
.PP
root 権限で以下を実施:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
mkdir /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares
chgrp foo /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares
chmod 1770 /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares
.fi
.RE
.PP
ついで、以下のパラメータ
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
	\fIusershare path = /usr/local/samba/lib/usershares\fR
	\fIusershare max shares = 10\fR # (もしくは必要な共有数)
.fi
.RE
.PP
を
\fIsmb\.conf\fRの global セクションに追加。 これにより foo グループのメンバは、以下のコマンドでユーザ定義共有を作成することが可能となる。
.PP
net usershare add sharename path [comment] [acl] [guest_ok=[y|n]]
.RS 4
これにより、ユーザ定義共有を作成もしくは修正(上書き)する。
.RE
.PP
net usershare delete sharename
.RS 4
ユーザ定義共有を削除する。
.RE
.PP
net usershare list wildcard\-sharename
.RS 4
ユーザ定義共有を一覧する。
.RE
.PP
net usershare info wildcard\-sharename
.RS 4
ユーザ定義共有の情報を表示する。
.RE
.SH "パラメータ"
.PP
パラメータはセクションの属性を定義するものである。
.PP
幾つかのパラメータ (\fIsecurity\fR
など) は、 [global] セクションで指定する。また幾つかのパラメータ (\fIcreate mask\fR
など) は、すべてのセクションで 利用可能である。それ以外のパラメータは、通常のセクションでのみ 利用できる。以下の説明では、[homes] と [printers] セクションを "通常の" セクションとして扱う。(\fIG\fR) がついたパラメータは、 [global] セクションでのみ指定できる。(\fIS\fR) がついたパラメータは、個々のサービスを表すセクションで指定できる。 ただし、(\fIS\fR) がついたパラメータは、[global] セクション中で指定することも可能である。この場合、それらはすべての サービスに対するデフォルト値として機能する。
.PP
パラメータはアルファベット順に説明されている。 最良の順序とはいえないが、少なくとも目的のパラメータを見つけることは できるだろう。同義語がある場合は、主として用いるべき表記の部分で 説明が行なわれ、他はその表記への参照になっている。
.SH "変数による置換"
.PP
設定ファイルに記述可能な文字列の多くには、変数による置換を利用できる。 たとえば、\(lqpath = /tmp/%u\(rq
は、john というユーザ名でユーザが 接続すると、\(lqpath = /tmp/john\(rq
として解釈される。
.PP
これら置換の詳細については、各々のパラメータの説明にて 解説するが、どのパラメータに対しても適用される共通の変数置換もいくつか 存在する。それらを以下に記載する:
.PP
%U
.RS 4
セッションのユーザ名 (クライアントが接続時に 送信したものであるが、実際に接続したユーザ名と同じであるとは 限らない)。
.RE
.PP
%G
.RS 4
%U のプライマリグループ。
.RE
.PP
%h
.RS 4
Samba が動作しているマシンの インターネットホスト名。

.PP
%m
.RS 4
クライアントマシンの NetBIOS 名 (とても便利)。
.sp
Samba がポート 445 で待機している場合、クライアントがこの情報を送信しないため、この変数は利用できない。 Samba がドメインコントローラであるドメインで include パラメータにおいてこの変数を用いている場合などは、 [global] セクションで
\fIsmb ports = 139\fR
の設定を行なうこと。 これにより Samba はポート 445 で待機しなくなり、Samba 2\.X で実現していた include 機能が利用できる。
.RE
.PP

短縮時の動作を制御するパラメータが幾つか存在しており、 それらは個々に解説を行なわず、ここでまとめて説明を行なう。 デフォルト値は testparm コマンドの出力を参照のこと。
.PP
以下のオプションは、すべて共有毎に設定できる (もちろん全体に対しても設定できる)。
.PP
オプションは以下の通りである:
.PP
case sensitive = yes/no/auto
.RS 4
ファイル名の case を識別するかどうかを制御する。 識別を行なわない場合、Samba は指定された名前に合致する ファイル名の有無を検索することが必要になる。デフォルトは
\fIauto\fR

.RE
.PP
default case = upper/lower
.RS 4
新しく作成されるファイル(現在ファイルシステム上に存在していないファイル)のファイル名のデフォルトの case を制御する。 デフォルトは

\fIpreserve case = No\fR、
\fIshort preserve case = No\fR

.RE
.PP
Samba 3\.0 のデフォルトは、Windows NT のサーバと同様に動作する。 すなわち、case を識別しないが case は保持する。 ただし、大量のファイルが存在するディレクトリにおいては、case 関連のパラメータを "case sensitive = yes"、"case preserve = no"、"short preserve case = no" に設定するとよいであろう。 これにより、"default case" パラメータが有効になり、クライアントから送信されるすべてのファイル名が変更される。 (訳注: 上記設定は、case sensitive = yes によりファイル名の検索を抑止することで、パフォーマンスを向上させようとする意図だと思われる)

acl check permissions (S)
.PP
.RS 4
This boolean parameter controls what
\fBsmbd\fR(8)does on receiving a protocol request of "open for delete" from a Windows client\. If a Windows client doesn\'t have permissions to delete a file then they expect this to be denied at open time\. POSIX systems normally only detect restrictions on delete by actually attempting to delete the file or directory\. As Windows clients can (and do) "back out" a delete request by unsetting the "delete on close" bit Samba cannot delete the file immediately on "open for delete" request as we cannot restore such a deleted file\. With this parameter set to true (the default) then smbd checks the file system permissions directly on "open for delete" and denies the request without actually deleting the file if the file system permissions would seem to deny it\. This is not perfect, as it\'s possible a user could have deleted a file without Samba being able to check the permissions correctly, but it is close enough to Windows semantics for mostly correct behaviour\. Samba will correctly check POSIX ACL semantics in this case\.
.sp
If this parameter is set to "false" Samba doesn\'t check permissions on "open for delete" and allows the open\. If the user doesn\'t have permission to delete the file this will only be discovered at close time, which is too late for the Windows user tools to display an error message to the user\. The symptom of this is files that appear to have been deleted "magically" re\-appearing on a Windows explorer refersh\. This is an extremely advanced protocol option which should not need to be changed\. This parameter was introduced in its final form in 3\.0\.21, an earlier version with slightly different semantics was introduced in 3\.0\.20\. That older version is not documented here\.

\fIauto\fR\. If you specify

acl group control (S)
.PP
.RS 4
In a POSIX filesystem, only the owner of a file or directory and the superuser can modify the permissions and ACLs on a file\. If this parameter is set, then Samba overrides this restriction, and also allows the
\fIprimary group owner\fR
of a file or directory to modify the permissions and ACLs on that file\.
.sp
On a Windows server, groups may be the owner of a file or directory \- thus allowing anyone in that group to modify the permissions on it\. This allows the delegation of security controls on a point in the filesystem to the group owner of a directory and anything below it also owned by that group\. This means there are multiple people with permissions to modify ACLs on a file or directory, easing managability\.
.sp
This parameter allows Samba to also permit delegation of the control over a point in the exported directory hierarchy in much the same way as Windows\. This allows all members of a UNIX group to control the permissions on a file or directory they have group ownership on\.
.sp
This parameter is best used with the
\fIinherit owner\fR
option and also on on a share containing directories with the UNIX
\fIsetgid bit\fR
set on them, which causes new files and directories created within it to inherit the group ownership from the containing directory\.
.sp
This is parameter has been was deprecated in Samba 3\.0\.23, but re\-activated in Samba 3\.0\.31 and above, as it now only controls permission changes if the user is in the owning primary group\. It is now no longer equivalent to the
\fIdos filemode\fR

Normally, a Samba server requires that UNIX users are created for all users accessing files on this server\.

also binds to the "all addresses" interface (0\.0\.0\.0) on ports 137 and 138 for the purposes of reading broadcast messages\. If this option is not set then
nmbd
will service name requests on all of these sockets\. If
\fIbind interfaces only\fR
is set then
nmbd
will check the source address of any packets coming in on the broadcast sockets and discard any that don\'t match the broadcast addresses of the interfaces in the
\fIinterfaces\fR
parameter list\. As unicast packets are received on the other sockets it allows
nmbd
to refuse to serve names to machines that send packets that arrive through any interfaces not listed in the
\fIinterfaces\fR
list\. IP Source address spoofing does defeat this simple check, however, so it must not be used seriously as a security feature for
nmbd\.
.sp
For file service it causes
\fBsmbd\fR(8)
to bind only to the interface list given in the
\fIinterfaces\fR
parameter\. This restricts the networks that
smbd
will serve, to packets coming in on those interfaces\. Note that you should not use this parameter for machines that are serving PPP or other intermittent or non\-broadcast network interfaces as it will not cope with non\-permanent interfaces\.

.sp
To change a users SMB password, the
smbpasswd
by default connects to the
\fIlocalhost \- 127\.0\.0\.1\fR
address as an SMB client to issue the password change request\. If
\fIbind interfaces only\fR
is set then unless the network address
\fI127\.0\.0\.1\fR
is added to the
\fIinterfaces\fR
parameter list then
smbpasswd
will fail to connect in it\'s default mode\.
smbpasswd
can be forced to use the primary IP interface of the local host by using its
\fBsmbpasswd\fR(8)
\fI\-r \fR\fI\fIremote machine\fR\fR
parameter, with
\fIremote machine\fR
set to the IP name of the primary interface of the local host\.
.sp
The
swat
status page tries to connect with
smbd
and
nmbd
at the address
\fI127\.0\.0\.1\fR
to determine if they are running\. Not adding
\fI127\.0\.0\.1\fR
will cause
smbd
and
nmbd
to always show "not running" even if they really are\. This can prevent
swat

Because smbd is unable to execute the driver code to generate the device mode, the default behavior is to set this field to NULL\.
.sp
Most problems with serving printer drivers to Windows NT/2k/XP clients can be traced to a problem with the generated device mode\. Certain drivers will do things such as crashing the client\'s Explorer\.exe with a NULL devmode\. However, other printer drivers can cause the client\'s spooler service (spoolsv\.exe) to die if the devmode was not created by the driver itself (i\.e\. smbd generates a default devmode)\.
.sp
This parameter should be used with care and tested with the printer driver in question\. It is better to leave the device mode to NULL and let the Windows client set the correct values\. Because drivers do not do this all the time, setting
default devmode = yes
will instruct smbd to generate a default one\.

The first enhancement to browse propagation consists of a regular wildcard query to a Samba WINS server for all Domain Master Browsers, followed by a browse synchronization with each of the returned DMBs\. The second enhancement consists of a regular randomised browse synchronization with all currently known DMBs\.
.sp
You may wish to disable this option if you have a problem with empty workgroups not disappearing from browse lists\. Due to the restrictions of the browse protocols these enhancements can cause a empty workgroup to stay around forever which can be annoying\.

In general you should leave this option enabled as it makes cross\-subnet browse propagation much more reliable\.

enumports command (G)

The concept of a "port" is fairly foreign to UNIX hosts\. Under Windows NT/2000 print servers, a port is associated with a port monitor and generally takes the form of a local port (i\.e\. LPT1:, COM1:, FILE:) or a remote port (i\.e\. LPD Port Monitor, etc\.\.\.)\. By default, Samba has only one port defined\-\-\fB"Samba Printer Port"\fR\. Under Windows NT/2000, all printers must have a valid port name\. If you wish to have a list of ports displayed (smbd
does not use a port name for anything) other than the default
\fB"Samba Printer Port"\fR, you can define
\fIenumports command\fR

fake directory create times (S)
.PP
.RS 4
NTFS and Windows VFAT file systems keep a create time for all files and directories\. This is not the same as the ctime \- status change time \- that Unix keeps, so Samba by default reports the earliest of the various times Unix does keep\. Setting this parameter for a share causes Samba to always report midnight 1\-1\-1980 as the create time for directories\.
.sp
This option is mainly used as a compatibility option for Visual C++ when used against Samba shares\. Visual C++ generated makefiles have the object directory as a dependency for each object file, and a make rule to create the directory\. Also, when NMAKE compares timestamps it uses the creation time when examining a directory\. Thus the object directory will be created if it does not exist, but once it does exist it will always have an earlier timestamp than the object files it contains\.
.sp
However, Unix time semantics mean that the create time reported by Samba will be updated whenever a file is created or or deleted in the directory\. NMAKE finds all object files in the object directory\. The timestamp of the last one built is then compared to the timestamp of the object directory\. If the directory\'s timestamp if newer, then all object files will be rebuilt\. Enabling this option ensures directories always predate their contents and an NMAKE build will proceed as expected\.

fake oplocks (S)
.PP
.RS 4
Oplocks are the way that SMB clients get permission from a server to locally cache file operations\. If a server grants an oplock (opportunistic lock) then the client is free to assume that it is the only one accessing the file and it will aggressively cache file data\. With some oplock types the client may even cache file open/close operations\. This can give enormous performance benefits\.
.sp
When you set
fake oplocks = yes,
\fBsmbd\fR(8)
will always grant oplock requests no matter how many clients are using the file\.
.sp
It is generally much better to use the real
\fIoplocks\fR
support rather than this parameter\.
.sp
If you enable this option on all read\-only shares or shares that you know will only be accessed from one client at a time such as physically read\-only media like CDROMs, you will see a big performance improvement on many operations\. If you enable this option on shares where multiple clients may be accessing the files read\-write at the same time you can get data corruption\. Use this option carefully!

force group (S)
.PP
.RS 4
This specifies a UNIX group name that will be assigned as the default primary group for all users connecting to this service\. This is useful for sharing files by ensuring that all access to files on service will use the named group for their permissions checking\. Thus, by assigning permissions for this group to the files and directories within this service the Samba administrator can restrict or allow sharing of these files\.
.sp
In Samba 2\.0\.5 and above this parameter has extended functionality in the following way\. If the group name listed here has a \'+\' character prepended to it then the current user accessing the share only has the primary group default assigned to this group if they are already assigned as a member of that group\. This allows an administrator to decide that only users who are already in a particular group will create files with group ownership set to that group\. This gives a finer granularity of ownership assignment\. For example, the setting
\fIforce group = +sys\fR
means that only users who are already in group sys will have their default primary group assigned to sys when accessing this Samba share\. All other users will retain their ordinary primary group\.

If the
\fIforce user\fR

force printername (S)
.PP
.RS 4
When printing from Windows NT (or later), each printer in
\fIsmb\.conf\fR
has two associated names which can be used by the client\. The first is the sharename (or shortname) defined in smb\.conf\. This is the only printername available for use by Windows 9x clients\. The second name associated with a printer can be seen when browsing to the "Printers" (or "Printers and Faxes") folder on the Samba server\. This is referred to simply as the printername (not to be confused with the
\fIprinter name\fR
option)\.
.sp
When assigning a new driver to a printer on a remote Windows compatible print server such as Samba, the Windows client will rename the printer to match the driver name just uploaded\. This can result in confusion for users when multiple printers are bound to the same driver\. To prevent Samba from allowing the printer\'s printername to differ from the sharename defined in smb\.conf, set
\fIforce printername = yes\fR\.
.sp
Be aware that enabling this parameter may affect migrating printers from a Windows server to Samba since Windows has no way to force the sharename and printername to match\.

It is recommended that this parameter\'s value not be changed once the printer is in use by clients as this could cause a user not be able to delete printer connections from their local Printers folder\.

This is designed to allow Windows NT clients to copy files and folders containing ACLs that were created locally on the client machine and contain users local to that machine only (no domain users) to be copied to a Samba server (usually with XCOPY /O) and have the unknown userid and groupid of the file owner map to the current connected user\.

hosts allow (S)
.PP
.RS 4
A synonym for this parameter is
\fIallow hosts\fR\.
.sp
This parameter is a comma, space, or tab delimited set of hosts which are permitted to access a service\.
.sp
If specified in the [global] section then it will apply to all services, regardless of whether the individual service has a different setting\.
.sp
You can specify the hosts by name or IP number\. For example, you could restrict access to only the hosts on a Class C subnet with something like
allow hosts = 150\.203\.5\.\. The full syntax of the list is described in the man page
\fIhosts_access(5)\fR\. Note that this man page may not be present on your system, so a brief description will be given here also\.
.sp
Note that the localhost address 127\.0\.0\.1 will always be allowed access unless specifically denied by a
\fIhosts deny\fR
option\.
.sp
You can also specify hosts by network/netmask pairs and by netgroup names if your system supports netgroups\. The
\fIEXCEPT\fR
keyword can also be used to limit a wildcard list\. The following examples may provide some help:
.sp
Example 1: allow all IPs in 150\.203\.*\.*; except one
.sp
hosts allow = 150\.203\. EXCEPT 150\.203\.6\.66
.sp
Example 2: allow hosts that match the given network/netmask
.sp
hosts allow = 150\.203\.15\.0/255\.255\.255\.0
.sp
Example 3: allow a couple of hosts
.sp
hosts allow = lapland, arvidsjaur
.sp
Example 4: allow only hosts in NIS netgroup "foonet", but deny access from one particular host
.sp
hosts allow = @foonet

ldap replication sleep (G)
.PP
.RS 4
When Samba is asked to write to a read\-only LDAP replica, we are redirected to talk to the read\-write master server\. This server then replicates our changes back to the \'local\' server, however the replication might take some seconds, especially over slow links\. Certain client activities, particularly domain joins, can become confused by the \'success\' that does not immediately change the LDAP back\-end\'s data\.
.sp
This option simply causes Samba to wait a short time, to allow the LDAP server to catch up\. If you have a particularly high\-latency network, you may wish to time the LDAP replication with a network sniffer, and increase this value accordingly\. Be aware that no checking is performed that the data has actually replicated\.

The value is specified in milliseconds, the maximum value is 5000 (5 seconds)\.

ldapsam:editposix (G)
.PP
.RS 4
Editposix is an option that leverages ldapsam:trusted to make it simpler to manage a domain controller eliminating the need to set up custom scripts to add and manage the posix users and groups\. This option will instead directly manipulate the ldap tree to create, remove and modify user and group entries\. This option also requires a running winbindd as it is used to allocate new uids/gids on user/group creation\. The allocation range must be therefore configured\.
.sp
To use this option, a basic ldap tree must be provided and the ldap suffix parameters must be properly configured\. On virgin servers the default users and groups (Administrator, Guest, Domain Users, Domain Admins, Domain Guests) can be precreated with the command
net sam provision\. To run this command the ldap server must be running, Winindd must be running and the smb\.conf ldap options must be properly configured\. The typical ldap setup used with the
\fIldapsam:trusted = yes\fR
option is usually sufficient to use
\fIldapsam:editposix = yes\fR
as well\.
.sp
An example configuration can be the following:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
	encrypt passwords = true
	passdb backend = ldapsam

	ldapsam:trusted=yes
	ldapsam:editposix=yes

	ldap admin dn = cn=admin,dc=samba,dc=org

ldapsam:trusted (G)
.PP
.RS 4
By default, Samba as a Domain Controller with an LDAP backend needs to use the Unix\-style NSS subsystem to access user and group information\. Due to the way Unix stores user information in /etc/passwd and /etc/group this inevitably leads to inefficiencies\. One important question a user needs to know is the list of groups he is member of\. The plain UNIX model involves a complete enumeration of the file /etc/group and its NSS counterparts in LDAP\. UNIX has optimized functions to enumerate group membership\. Sadly, other functions that are used to deal with user and group attributes lack such optimization\.
.sp
To make Samba scale well in large environments, the
\fIldapsam:trusted = yes\fR
option assumes that the complete user and group database that is relevant to Samba is stored in LDAP with the standard posixAccount/posixGroup attributes\. It further assumes that the Samba auxiliary object classes are stored together with the POSIX data in the same LDAP object\. If these assumptions are met,
\fIldapsam:trusted = yes\fR
can be activated and Samba can bypass the NSS system to query user group memberships\. Optimized LDAP queries can greatly speed up domain logon and administration tasks\. Depending on the size of the LDAP database a factor of 100 or more for common queries is easily achieved\.

level2 oplocks (S)
.PP
.RS 4
This parameter controls whether Samba supports level2 (read\-only) oplocks on a share\.
.sp
Level2, or read\-only oplocks allow Windows NT clients that have an oplock on a file to downgrade from a read\-write oplock to a read\-only oplock once a second client opens the file (instead of releasing all oplocks on a second open, as in traditional, exclusive oplocks)\. This allows all openers of the file that support level2 oplocks to cache the file for read\-ahead only (ie\. they may not cache writes or lock requests) and increases performance for many accesses of files that are not commonly written (such as application \.EXE files)\.
.sp
Once one of the clients which have a read\-only oplock writes to the file all clients are notified (no reply is needed or waited for) and told to break their oplocks to "none" and delete any read\-ahead caches\.
.sp
It is recommended that this parameter be turned on to speed access to shared executables\.

This algorithm can cause name collisions only if files in a directory share the same first five alphanumeric characters\. The probability of such a clash is 1/1300\.

passwd chat (G)

This string controls the

\fBsmbd\fR(8)
uses to determine what to send to the
\fIpasswd program\fR
and what to expect back\. If the expected output is not received then the password is not changed\.
.sp
This chat sequence is often quite site specific, depending on what local methods are used for password control (such as NIS etc)\.
.sp
Note that this parameter only is used if the
\fIunix password sync\fR
parameter is set to
\fByes\fR\. This sequence is then called
\fIAS ROOT\fR
when the SMB password in the smbpasswd file is being changed, without access to the old password cleartext\. This means that root must be able to reset the user\'s password without knowing the text of the previous password\. In the presence of NIS/YP, this means that the
\fIpasswd program\fR
must be executed on the NIS master\.
.sp
The string can contain the macro
\fI%n\fR
which is substituted for the new password\. The old passsword (\fI%o\fR) is only available when
\fIencrypt passwords\fR
has been disabled\. The chat sequence can also contain the standard macros \en, \er, \et and \es to give line\-feed, carriage\-return, tab and space\. The chat sequence string can also contain a \'*\' which matches any sequence of characters\. Double quotes can be used to collect strings with spaces in them into a single string\.

If the

password level (G)
.PP
.RS 4
Some client/server combinations have difficulty with mixed\-case passwords\. One offending client is Windows for Workgroups, which for some reason forces passwords to upper case when using the LANMAN1 protocol, but leaves them alone when using COREPLUS! Another problem child is the Windows 95/98 family of operating systems\. These clients upper case clear text passwords even when NT LM 0\.12 selected by the protocol negotiation request/response\.
.sp
This parameter defines the maximum number of characters that may be upper case in passwords\.
.sp
For example, say the password given was "FRED"\. If
\fI password level\fR
is set to 1, the following combinations would be tried if "FRED" failed:
.sp
"Fred", "fred", "fRed", "frEd","freD"
.sp
If
\fIpassword level\fR
was set to 2, the following combinations would also be tried:
.sp
"FRed", "FrEd", "FreD", "fREd", "fReD", "frED", \.\.
.sp
And so on\.
.sp
The higher value this parameter is set to the more likely it is that a mixed case password will be matched against a single case password\. However, you should be aware that use of this parameter reduces security and increases the time taken to process a new connection\.
.sp
A value of zero will cause only two attempts to be made \- the password as is and the password in all\-lower case\.

By specifying the name of another SMB server or Active Directory domain controller with this option, and using

.sp
This option sets the name or IP address of the password server to use\. New syntax has been added to support defining the port to use when connecting to the server the case of an ADS realm\. To define a port other than the default LDAP port of 389, add the port number using a colon after the name or IP address (e\.g\. 192\.168\.1\.100:389)\. If you do not specify a port, Samba will use the standard LDAP port of tcp/389\. Note that port numbers have no effect on password servers for Windows NT 4\.0 domains or netbios connections\.
.sp
If parameter is a name, it is looked up using the parameter
\fIname resolve order\fR

.sp
If the
\fIsecurity\fR
parameter is set to
\fBdomain\fR
or
\fBads\fR, then the list of machines in this option must be a list of Primary or Backup Domain controllers for the Domain or the character \'*\', as the Samba server is effectively in that domain, and will use cryptographically authenticated RPC calls to authenticate the user logging on\. The advantage of using
security = domain
is that if you list several hosts in the
\fIpassword server\fR
option then
smbd
will try each in turn till it finds one that responds\. This is useful in case your primary server goes down\.
.sp
If the
\fIpassword server\fR
option is set to the character \'*\', then Samba will attempt to auto\-locate the Primary or Backup Domain controllers to authenticate against by doing a query for the name
\fBWORKGROUP<1C>\fR
and then contacting each server returned in the list of IP addresses from the name resolution source\.
.sp
If the list of servers contains both names/IP\'s and the \'*\' character, the list is treated as a list of preferred domain controllers, but an auto lookup of all remaining DC\'s will be added to the list as well\. Samba will not attempt to optimize this list by locating the closest DC\.

profile acls (S)
.PP
.RS 4
This boolean parameter was added to fix the problems that people have been having with storing user profiles on Samba shares from Windows 2000 or Windows XP clients\. New versions of Windows 2000 or Windows XP service packs do security ACL checking on the owner and ability to write of the profile directory stored on a local workstation when copied from a Samba share\.
.sp
When not in domain mode with winbindd then the security info copied onto the local workstation has no meaning to the logged in user (SID) on that workstation so the profile storing fails\. Adding this parameter onto a share used for profile storage changes two things about the returned Windows ACL\. Firstly it changes the owner and group owner of all reported files and directories to be BUILTIN\e\eAdministrators, BUILTIN\e\eUsers respectively (SIDs S\-1\-5\-32\-544, S\-1\-5\-32\-545)\. Secondly it adds an ACE entry of "Full Control" to the SID BUILTIN\e\eUsers to every returned ACL\. This will allow any Windows 2000 or XP workstation user to access the profile\.
.sp
Note that if you have multiple users logging on to a workstation then in order to prevent them from being able to access each others profiles you must remove the "Bypass traverse checking" advanced user right\. This will prevent access to other users profile directories as the top level profile directory (named after the user) is created by the workstation profile code and has an ACL restricting entry to the directory tree to the owning user\.

security (G)

.RS 4
This option affects how clients respond to Samba and is one of the most important settings in the
\fI smb\.conf\fR
file\.
.sp
The option sets the "security mode bit" in replies to protocol negotiations with
\fBsmbd\fR(8)
to turn share level security on or off\. Clients decide based on this bit whether (and how) to transfer user and password information to the server\.
.sp
The default is
security = user, as this is the most common setting needed when talking to Windows 98 and Windows NT\.
.sp
The alternatives are
security = share,
security = server
or
security = domain\.
.sp
In versions of Samba prior to 2\.0\.0, the default was
security = share
mainly because that was the only option at one stage\.
.sp
There is a bug in WfWg that has relevance to this setting\. When in user or server level security a WfWg client will totally ignore the username and password you type in the "connect drive" dialog box\. This makes it very difficult (if not impossible) to connect to a Samba service as anyone except the user that you are logged into WfWg as\.
.sp
If your PCs use usernames that are the same as their usernames on the UNIX machine then you will want to use
security = user\. If you mostly use usernames that don\'t exist on the UNIX box then use
security = share\.
.sp
You should also use
security = share
if you want to mainly setup shares without a password (guest shares)\. This is commonly used for a shared printer server\. It is more difficult to setup guest shares with
security = user, see the
\fImap to guest\fRparameter for details\.

\fINetBIOS aliases\fR\.
.sp
The different settings will now be explained\.
.sp
\fISECURITY = SHARE\fR
.sp
When clients connect to a share level security server they need not log onto the server with a valid username and password before attempting to connect to a shared resource (although modern clients such as Windows 95/98 and Windows NT will send a logon request with a username but no password when talking to a
security = share
server)\. Instead, the clients send authentication information (passwords) on a per\-share basis, at the time they attempt to connect to that share\.
.sp
Note that
smbd
\fIALWAYS\fR
uses a valid UNIX user to act on behalf of the client, even in
security = share
level security\.

security mask (S)
.PP
.RS 4
This parameter controls what UNIX permission bits will be set when a Windows NT client is manipulating the UNIX permission on a file using the native NT security dialog box\.
.sp
This parameter is applied as a mask (AND\'ed with) to the incoming permission bits, thus resetting any bits not in this mask\. Make sure not to mix up this parameter with
\fIforce security mode\fR, which works in a manner similar to this one but uses a logical OR instead of an AND\.

smb encrypt (S)
.PP
.RS 4
This is a new feature introduced with Samba 3\.2 and above\. It is an extension to the SMB/CIFS protocol negotiated as part of the UNIX extensions\. SMB encryption uses the GSSAPI (SSPI on Windows) ability to encrypt and sign every request/response in a SMB protocol stream\. When enabled it provides a secure method of SMB/CIFS communication, similar to an ssh protected session, but using SMB/CIFS authentication to negotiate encryption and signing keys\. Currently this is only supported by Samba 3\.2 smbclient, and hopefully soon Linux CIFSFS and MacOS/X clients\. Windows clients do not support this feature\.
.sp
This controls whether the server offers or requires the client it talks to to use SMB encryption\. Possible values are
\fIauto\fR,
\fImandatory\fR
and
\fIdisabled\fR\. This may be set on a per\-share basis, but clients may chose to encrypt the entire session, not just traffic to a specific share\. If this is set to mandatory then all traffic to a share
\fImust\fR
must be encrypted once the connection has been made to the share\. The server would return "access denied" to all non\-encrypted requests on such a share\. Selecting encrypted traffic reduces throughput as smaller packet sizes must be used (no huge UNIX style read/writes allowed) as well as the overhead of encrypting and signing all the data\.
.sp
If SMB encryption is selected, Windows style SMB signing (see the
\fIserver signing\fR
option) is no longer necessary, as the GSSAPI flags use select both signing and sealing of the data\.

When set to auto, SMB encryption is offered, but not enforced\. When set to mandatory, SMB encryption is required and if set to disabled, SMB encryption can not be negotiated\.

use client driver (S)
.PP
.RS 4
This parameter applies only to Windows NT/2000 clients\. It has no effect on Windows 95/98/ME clients\. When serving a printer to Windows NT/2000 clients without first installing a valid printer driver on the Samba host, the client will be required to install a local printer driver\. From this point on, the client will treat the print as a local printer and not a network printer connection\. This is much the same behavior that will occur when
disable spoolss = yes\.
.sp
The differentiating factor is that under normal circumstances, the NT/2000 client will attempt to open the network printer using MS\-RPC\. The problem is that because the client considers the printer to be local, it will attempt to issue the OpenPrinterEx() call requesting access rights associated with the logged on user\. If the user possesses local administator rights but not root privilege on the Samba host (often the case), the OpenPrinterEx() call will fail\. The result is that the client will now display an "Access Denied; Unable to connect" message in the printer queue window (even though jobs may successfully be printed)\.
.sp
If this parameter is enabled for a printer, then any attempt to open the printer with the PRINTER_ACCESS_ADMINISTER right is mapped to PRINTER_ACCESS_USE instead\. Thus allowing the OpenPrinterEx() call to succeed\.

username (S)
.PP
.RS 4
Multiple users may be specified in a comma\-delimited list, in which case the supplied password will be tested against each username in turn (left to right)\.
.sp
The
\fIusername\fR
line is needed only when the PC is unable to supply its own username\. This is the case for the COREPLUS protocol or where your users have different WfWg usernames to UNIX usernames\. In both these cases you may also be better using the \e\eserver\eshare%user syntax instead\.
.sp
The
\fIusername\fR
line is not a great solution in many cases as it means Samba will try to validate the supplied password against each of the usernames in the
\fIusername\fR
line in turn\. This is slow and a bad idea for lots of users in case of duplicate passwords\. You may get timeouts or security breaches using this parameter unwisely\.
.sp
Samba relies on the underlying UNIX security\. This parameter does not restrict who can login, it just offers hints to the Samba server as to what usernames might correspond to the supplied password\. Users can login as whoever they please and they will be able to do no more damage than if they started a telnet session\. The daemon runs as the user that they log in as, so they cannot do anything that user cannot do\.
.sp
To restrict a service to a particular set of users you can use the
\fIvalid users\fR
parameter\.
.sp
If any of the usernames begin with a \'@\' then the name will be looked up first in the NIS netgroups list (if Samba is compiled with netgroup support), followed by a lookup in the UNIX groups database and will expand to a list of all users in the group of that name\.
.sp
If any of the usernames begin with a \'+\' then the name will be looked up only in the UNIX groups database and will expand to a list of all users in the group of that name\.

This option helps Samba to try and \'guess\' at the real UNIX username, as many DOS clients send an all\-uppercase username\. By default Samba tries all lowercase, followed by the username with the first letter capitalized, and fails if the username is not found on the UNIX machine\.
.sp
If this parameter is set to non\-zero the behavior changes\. This parameter is a number that specifies the number of uppercase combinations to try while trying to determine the UNIX user name\.

username map (G)
.PP
.RS 4
This option allows you to specify a file containing a mapping of usernames from the clients to the server\. This can be used for several purposes\. The most common is to map usernames that users use on DOS or Windows machines to those that the UNIX box uses\. The other is to map multiple users to a single username so that they can more easily share files\.
.sp
Please note that for user or share mode security, the username map is applied prior to validating the user credentials\. Domain member servers (domain or ads) apply the username map after the user has been successfully authenticated by the domain controller and require fully qualified enties in the map table (e\.g\. biddle =
DOMAIN\efoo)\.
.sp
The map file is parsed line by line\. Each line should contain a single UNIX username on the left then a \'=\' followed by a list of usernames on the right\. The list of usernames on the right may contain names of the form @group in which case they will match any UNIX username in that group\. The special client name \'*\' is a wildcard and matches any name\. Each line of the map file may be up to 1023 characters long\.
.sp
The file is processed on each line by taking the supplied username and comparing it with each username on the right hand side of the \'=\' signs\. If the supplied name matches any of the names on the right hand side then it is replaced with the name on the left\. Processing then continues with the next line\.
.sp
If any line begins with a \'#\' or a \';\' then it is ignored\.
.sp
If any line begins with an \'!\' then the processing will stop after that line if a mapping was done by the line\. Otherwise mapping continues with every line being processed\. Using \'!\' is most useful when you have a wildcard mapping line later in the file\.
.sp
For example to map from the name
\fBadmin\fR
or
\fBadministrator\fR
to the UNIX name
\fB root\fR
you would use:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
root = admin administrator
.fi
.RE
.sp
Or to map anyone in the UNIX group
\fBsystem\fR
to the UNIX name
\fBsys\fR
you would use:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
sys = @system
.fi
.RE
.sp
.sp
You can have as many mappings as you like in a username map file\.
.sp
If your system supports the NIS NETGROUP option then the netgroup database is checked before the
\fI/etc/group \fR
database for matching groups\.
.sp
You can map Windows usernames that have spaces in them by using double quotes around the name\. For example:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
tridge = "Andrew Tridgell"
.fi
.RE
.sp
would map the windows username "Andrew Tridgell" to the unix username "tridge"\.
.sp
The following example would map mary and fred to the unix user sys, and map the rest to guest\. Note the use of the \'!\' to tell Samba to stop processing if it gets a match on that line:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
!sys = mary fred
guest = *
.fi
.RE
.sp
.sp
Note that the remapping is applied to all occurrences of usernames\. Thus if you connect to \e\eserver\efred and
\fBfred\fR
is remapped to
\fBmary\fR
then you will actually be connecting to \e\eserver\emary and will need to supply a password suitable for
\fBmary\fR
not
\fBfred\fR\. The only exception to this is the username passed to the
\fIpassword server\fR
(if you have one)\. The password server will receive whatever username the client supplies without modification\.
.sp
Also note that no reverse mapping is done\. The main effect this has is with printing\. Users who have been mapped may have trouble deleting print jobs as PrintManager under WfWg will think they don\'t own the print job\.
.sp
Samba versions prior to 3\.0\.8 would only support reading the fully qualified username (e\.g\.:
DOMAIN\euser) from the username map when performing a kerberos login from a client\. However, when looking up a map entry for a user authenticated by NTLM[SSP], only the login name would be used for matches\. This resulted in inconsistent behavior sometimes even on the same server\.
.sp
The following functionality is obeyed in version 3\.0\.8 and later:
.sp
When performing local authentication, the username map is applied to the login name before attempting to authenticate the connection\.
.sp
When relying upon a external domain controller for validating authentication requests, smbd will apply the username map to the fully qualified username (i\.e\.
DOMAIN\euser) only after the user has been successfully authenticated\.

When Samba is running as a WINS server this allows you to call an external program for all changes to the WINS database\. The primary use for this option is to allow the dynamic update of external name resolution databases such as dynamic DNS\.

write cache size (S)
.PP
.RS 4
If this integer parameter is set to non\-zero value, Samba will create an in\-memory cache for each oplocked file (it does
\fInot\fR
do this for non\-oplocked files)\. All writes that the client does not request to be flushed directly to disk will be stored in this cache if possible\. The cache is flushed onto disk when a write comes in whose offset would not fit into the cache or when the file is closed by the client\. Reads for the file are also served from this cache if the data is stored within it\.
.sp
This cache allows Samba to batch client writes into a more efficient write size for RAID disks (i\.e\. writes may be tuned to be the RAID stripe size) and can improve performance on systems where the disk subsystem is a bottleneck but there is free memory for userspace programs\.
