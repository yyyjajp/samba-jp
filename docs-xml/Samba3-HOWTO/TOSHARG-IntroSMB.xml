この本はSambaについての本である。多くの人の善意と、努力と、たくさんの作業から出
来上がったツールである。この本には、我々の後に続く人と同じように、価値をお互い
に分け与える絶え間ない信条で寄贈されてきたものを含む。

<para>
この本は、Microsoftネットワーク管理者の必要に適合するために企画された。必要として
いると考えている情報を見つけにくいと不満があるかもしれないが、UNIX管理者もこの本
から得るところがある。そのため、もしもあなたがMicrosoft認定のスペシャリストならば、
この本はあなたの要求をかなり満たすはずである。もしもUNIXかLinux管理者ならば、
現在の関心事に対する回答を探すのに苦労がないということにひどいと&smbmdash;
感じる必要性もない。

<title>Sambaとは何か?</title>

	<para>
        Sambaは巨大で複雑なプロジェクトである。Sambaプロジェクトは野心的でわくわく
        するものである。Sambaを支えているチームは世界中に分散した30余人からなり、
        興味深い範囲のバックグラウンドから来ている。このチームには科学者、エンジ
        ニア、プログラマ、ビジネスマンと学生がいる。
	</para>

	<para>
	Team members were drawn into active participation through the desire to help
	deliver an exciting level of transparent interoperability between Microsoft
	Windows and the non-Microsoft information
	technology world. 
	</para>

	<para>
	The slogan that unites the efforts behind the Samba project says:
	<emphasis>Samba, Opening Windows to a Wider World!</emphasis> The goal
	behind the project is one of removing barriers to interoperability.
	</para>

	<para>
	Samba provides file and print services for Microsoft Windows clients. These
	services may be hosted off any TCP/IP-enabled platform. The original deployment
	platforms were UNIX and Linux, though today it is in common use across
	a broad variety of systems.
	</para>

	<para>
	The Samba project includes not only an impressive feature set in file and print
	serving capabilities, but has been extended to include client functionality,
	utilities to ease migration to Samba, tools to aid interoperability with
	Microsoft Windows, and administration tools.
	</para>

	<para>
	The real people behind Samba are users like you. You have inspired the
	developers (the Samba Team) to do more than any of them imagined could or should
	be done. User feedback drives Samba development. Samba-3 in particular incorporates
	a huge amount of work done as a result of user requests, suggestions and direct
	code contributions.
	</para>

<title>Why This Book?</title>

	<para>
	There is admittedly a large number of Samba books on the market today and
	each book has its place. Despite the apparent plethora of books, Samba
	as a project continues to receive much criticism for failing to provide
	sufficient documentation. Samba is also criticized for being too complex
	and too difficult to configure. In many ways this is evidence of the
	success of Samba as there would be no complaints if it was not successful.
	</para>

	<para>
	The Samba Team members work predominantly with UNIX and Linux, so
	it is hardly surprising that existing Samba documentation should reflect
	that orientation. The original HOWTO text documents were intended to provide
	some tips, a few golden nuggets, and if they helped anyone then that was
	just wonderful. But the HOWTO documents lacked structure and context. They were
	isolated snapshots of information that were written to pass information
	on to someone else who might benefit. They reflected a need to transmit
	more information that could be conveniently put into manual pages.
	</para>

	<para>
	The original HOWTO documents were written by different authors. Most HOWTO
	documents are the result of feedback and contributions from numerous
	authors. In this book we took care to preserve as much original content as
	possible. As you read this book you will note that chapters were written by
	multiple authors, each of whom has his own style. This demonstrates
	the nature of the Open Source software development process.
	</para>

	<para>
	Out of the original HOWTO documents sprang a collection of unofficial
	HOWTO documents that are spread over the Internet. It is sincerely intended
	that this work will <emphasis>not</emphasis> replace the valuable unofficial 
	HOWTO work that continues to flourish. If you are involved in unofficial 
	HOWTO production then please continue your work!
	</para>

	<para>
	Those of you who have dedicated your labors to the production of unofficial
	HOWTOs, to Web page information regarding Samba, or to answering questions
	on the mailing lists or elsewhere, may be aware that this is a labor
	of love. We would like to know about your contribution and willingly receive
	the precious pearls of wisdom you have collected. Please email your contribution to
	<ulink noescape="1" url="mailto:jht@samba.org">John H. Terpstra (jht@samba.org)</ulink>.
	As a service to other users we will gladly adopt material that is technically accurate.
	</para>

	<para>
	Existing Samba books are largely addressed to the UNIX administrator.
	From the perspective of this target group the existing books serve
	an adequate purpose, with one exception &smbmdash; now that Samba-3 is out
	they need to be updated!
	</para>

	<para>
	This book, the <emphasis>Official Samba-3 HOWTO and Reference Guide</emphasis>,
	includes the Samba-HOWTO-Collection.pdf that ships with Samba.
	These documents have been written with a new design intent and purpose.
	</para>

	<para>
	Over the past two years many Microsoft network administrators have adopted
	Samba and have become interested in its deployment. Their information needs
	are very different from that of the UNIX administrator. This book has been
	arranged and the information presented from the perspective of someone with previous
	Microsoft Windows network administrative training and experience.

	This book is presented in six parts:
	</para>

	<variablelist>
		<varlistentry><term>General Installation</term>
			<listitem><para>
			Designed to help you get Samba-3 running quickly.
			The Fast Start chapter is a direct response to requests from
			Microsoft network administrators for some sample configurations
			that <emphasis>just work</emphasis>.
			</para></listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry><term>Server Configuration Basics</term>
			<listitem><para>
			The purpose of this section is to aid the transition from existing
			Microsoft Windows network knowledge to Samba terminology and norms.

			Samba server.
			</para></listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry><term>Advanced Configuration</term>
			<listitem><para>
			The mechanics of network browsing have long been the Achilles heel of
			all Microsoft Windows users. Samba-3 introduces new user and machine
			account management facilities, a new way to map UNIX groups and Windows
			groups, Interdomain trusts, new loadable file system drivers (VFS), and
			more. New with this document is expanded printing documentation, as well
			as a wealth of information regarding desktop and user policy handling,
			use of desktop profiles, and techniques for enhanced network integration.
			This section makes up the core of the book. Read and enjoy.
			</para></listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry><term>Migration and Updating</term>
			<listitem><para>

			issues are when moving from Samba-2.x to Samba-3.
			</para></listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry><term>Troubleshooting</term>

			for most users, or are a little left of field to be included in the
			main body of information.
			</para></listitem>
		</varlistentry>
