          This option can be used to make use of the change notify privilege.
          By default notify results are not checked against the file system
          permissions.
        </para>
        <para>
          If "honor change notify privilege" is enabled, a user will only
          receive notify results, if he has change notify privilege or
          sufficient file system permissions. If a user has the change notify
          privilege, he will receive all requested notify results, even if the
          user does not have the permissions on the file system.
